**Introduction**
Hey there! Welcome to the AI Lab Repository, a place where I store all the cool assignments, projects, and tasks related to our AI lab work. This repo includes everything from basic algorithms to more complex AI projects like games and problem-solving approaches. It's meant to help fellow students understand key AI concepts through hands-on coding exercises.

**What's Inside?**
Lab Assignments: These are the step-by-step exercises we did during our AI labs, covering different topics like search algorithms, machine learning models, and heuristics.
Projects: Larger AI-based projects, such as developing simple games or applying AI concepts to real-world problems.
Algorithms: Includes implementations of key AI algorithms, like A* search, decision trees, and other search methods.
